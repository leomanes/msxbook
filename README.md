Tips and tricks:\
*** When soldering the EDGE connector, make sure the distance between the PCB and the connector is between 2mm and 3mm. \
*** The distance between the bottom the main PCB and the top ot the angled pin header is 7.3mm \
*** Make sure the angled pin header and EDGE connectors are at a nice 90°. Start by solderins pins 1, 2 and 49, 50 and then do a fit test. \
*** To insert the pcb into the 3D cart, angle it 45° and insert the left side first ("left" when looking at inside the EDGE where the cart connects) then slide the board in, sitting it flush. \
